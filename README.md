# what is What The Bug?
wtb is open source base for learning.

This is the codebase for what-the-bug.tk (or just wtb) . wtb offers a learning environment to learn all essentials of python and a fun part to read about the author's developer journey. We value supportive and constructive feedback from users to improve user experience and providing better services. The ecosystem provides the user an opportunity to learn and welcomes any developer on his/her roadmap (either beginner/expert) to gain either a new experience in development or brush up their skills.
